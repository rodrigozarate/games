# Games IN PYTHON
## HANGMAN
The idea was to keep it simple so you just have to type letters or the whole word to guess the secret word.

Its a single file that will run in python 3.8.x
NOT tested in another version so let me know if you tryed and it works

## It's under development
Bear in mind that this is just a simple test of creating a game in python

## Instalation
Just download the file and navigate the console to the place you download the file (or move it where you want to and navigate accordingly) 
Type `./hangman.py` on the Terminal to initiate te game
To quit press CTRL-D or wait until you waste all your attempts to guess (7)

## END of game
